            Planning does not necessarily mean about what you wish your child would grow up to be, or have certain
            characteristics,
            but it also essentially means you as a responsible parent having various obligations to fulfill that would
            help him to grow better in this world.
            <br>
            Life insurance plays an important role in an individual's financial planning exercise. Insurance can assist
            individuals in planning for their own life stages as well as provide for their child's future. It also
            secures the childâ€™s future in case of any unfortunate event.
            Various types of child insurance products are available in the market today.
            <br>
            Child insurance plans have traditionally played an important role in securing the child's future. With a
            plethora of children insurance plans available in the market, it becomes difficult for most parents to
            evaluate them objectively.
            Individuals need to understand the dynamics for planning their children so that they can best utilize the
            alternatives available in the market.
